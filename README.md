# Battle Ship State Tracker
Single player (1 board, no enemy) battle ship game with state tracker console application in .NET Core 2.1.

## The Task
The task is to implement a Battleship state-tracker for a single player that must support the following logic:

* Create a board
* Add a battleship to the board
* Take an “attack” at a given position, and report back whether the attack resulted in a hit or a miss
* Return whether the player has lost the game yet (i.e. all battleships are sunk)

### Dependencies
* [.NET Core 2.1](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download)

### Unit Testing
**MSTest** : In Visual Studio, go to **`Test > Run > All Tests`**

### Setup Project
Project should be ready to run upon pulling the solution from github, should all dependencies requirements are met.

#### 1. Run the project
Run the project from visual studio and follow the instruction on the promt, or see below

#### 2. Instructions
